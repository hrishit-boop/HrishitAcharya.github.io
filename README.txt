Hi Github members!

Iâ€™m finishing a B. Sc degree with a Computer Science major and Math minor from the University of Alberta, Edmonton. Iâ€™m actively seeking part-time work or freelance projects as a programmer/coder while I continue my studies for another four (4) months (finishing end April 2025). Iâ€™m passionate about AI and game development, and Iâ€™m eager to apply what Iâ€™ve learned in real-world projects.

ðŸ”§ Skills & Experience:
-> Proficient in Python, C++, Java, Android development, SQL, C, Unreal Engine, C# and Unity.
-> Experience with NLPâ€™s, data scraping and extraction
-> Strong problem-solving abilities and a quick learner

Iâ€™m looking for opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with teams, and further learn and develop my skills. If youâ€™re in need of a dedicated and enthusiastic coder to join your team or work on specific tasks, Iâ€™d love to connect!

Feel free to reach out to me directly or drop me a message if you know of any part-time roles or freelance gigs that would be a good fit!
Thanks in advance! ðŸ˜Š
